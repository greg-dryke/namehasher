There are a couple other options available in the ps1. Just commented out for now.

Current one seems to work pretty well!

TODO:
* Figure out a way to keep altering the brightness, it mostly just increases now
* Simplfy the various functions and make flags for different ones that work?
* Make a way to show it easily! If nothing else, pop open a webpage with a query filed in for that color?
* Idea: chop the last binary number into 4, use one as brightness and other 3 as the colors. Would change the modulos though, would want more spread out, rather than trying to keep it on the right.
